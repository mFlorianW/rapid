=== Design and Implementation Principles

Public API::
The public API of a software component shall be implemented as interface, so other components that use this interface doesn't depend on a concrete implementation.
Except simple data classes doesn't need to be implemented as interfaces because these classes are mostly very simple.
This kind of classes shall only be used to exchange data between component and layers, they shall not contain any logic or behavior.

Dependency Injection::
The Dependency Injection principle shall be applied for dependencies if an object of another component is used and it's not a simple data class.
As example class A depends on class b. But class A is part of component A and class B is part of component B. 
Then the Dependency Injection Principle shall be applied. Look at the following examples. 
The first example shows the good case and the second one the bad case.

.Good Example for DI:
[source,cpp]
----
class A 
{
public:
    A(B b)  
        :mb(b)
    {   
    }

private
    B mB;
};

class B
{
};
---- 

.Bad Example:
[source,cpp]
----
class A 
{
public:
    A()
        :mb(new B{})
    {   
    }
private:
    B mB;
};

class B
{
};
----
This DI principle doesn't need to be applied when classes of the same component have a dependency.

=== Component Overview
The component diagram shows all components of the LaptimerCore.
The LaptimerCore is divided into three main layers. 
Ever layer have different responsibilities and requirements.
The middle layer of the system is the "CoreLayer".
This layer contains all platform independent software components and is divided into the components  "Algorithm", "SessionManagement", TrackManagement, "Positioning" and Workflow.
The lowest layer the "DataLayer" is responsible for storing the persistent data and realize the hardware specific access to the hardware e.g. GPS module.
The top layer the "PresentationLayer" of the LaptimerCore contains the GUI implementation for the middle. 
The implementation of this layer depends on the used system.
So is not part of the architecture  documentation because the LaptimerCore is designed to make it easy as possible to change the GUI.
This is also applicable to the "DataLayer".

Algorithm::
The `Algorithm` component contains all algorithm to calculate things like the lap time based on GNSS and track data, to detect a specific track based on the GNSS data, calculate the fastest possible lap out of different laps and other algorithms.

SessionManagement::
This component contains all relevant classes for the session management, e.g. save, filter and load. 
Value classes for the session data exchange between components and layers are also part of this component.
Additionally the component provides the required interfaces for the "DataLayer" also.

Positioning::
That component define the platform independent interfaces for accessing the GNSS and sensors data like a velocity sensor.

TrackManagement::
The Track component contains the interfaces for the "DataLayer" and provides value classes to exchange the track information between the components and layers.

Workflow::
Implements the business logic based on the data provided by the other components. 
This are workflows like the `IActiveSessionWorkflow` to control the current running session.

Common::
Contains cross cutting functionality like the logging mechanisms that can be used by all components. This module contains also data classes that are used by other components to exchange
data between them.
